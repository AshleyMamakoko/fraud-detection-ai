# Fraud Detection AI Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates an AI-based fraud detection system for an online payment system using Logistic Regression and Random Forest, with SMOTE to address class imbalance. The goal is to detect fraudulent transactions and protect customer trust.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of synthetic payment data
- Cause analysis to identify fraud patterns
- Data preprocessing and SMOTE oversampling
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest model evaluation
- Confusion matrices and AUC scores for model performance
- Proposed AI solution for real-time fraud detection

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.13
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fraud-detection-ai.git
